# Examples

This directory contains examples of mods that perform a specific function.
To run them, you can add them as a "local mod", in the Arma Launcher and then
enable them (don't forget to also enable `@Pythia` and to disable BattlEye).

Of course, you don't need to (but you can!) create separate mods containing
only Python code. You can simply add the directory containing the `$PYTHIA$`
file to your own mod and it will work as well.
